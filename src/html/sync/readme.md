This directory contains the latest generated photo data for distribution across all frames on request. This data is generated and written at a regular pre-defined interval via a server-side service/daemon. This daemon is found in the /src/bin directory. For optimal performance this should be a tmpfs mounted directory so that data is stored in memory, rather than contiually reading/writing to disk.
